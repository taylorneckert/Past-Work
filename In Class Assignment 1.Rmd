I have only lived in Louisville recently, In fact, I grew up in _Cincinnati_ and went to The **University of Cincinnati** Where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. I moved to Louisville for my first job when I graduated in 2016. That job ended up being terrible, but ended up working out for the best because I came to the job I'm at now, Assistant General Manager at PBR Louisville on Fourth Street Live.

I actually began the Data Analytics program at Bellarmine University, but took a break halfway through and they cancelled the program on me. I didn't want to give up becuase I ultimately want to do something in this field. 
I enjoy traveling, kayaking, and hanging out with my dog.
